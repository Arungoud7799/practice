Truthfully, I am not enough to steer clear of. To fall in love again, 
dear, reforested bund, is a matter of preservation. In your expert 
opinion, will you tell me how to know you if I am forever meant 
to leave you undisturbed. This will not save us, I’m afraid. A brownstone 
for hummingbirds is shortsighted too, like picking out honeybees 
from the dog’s mouth. Then blowing on her tiny hairs like a breeze. 
Love, we can wish it were so; it does not make us fit to survive.
